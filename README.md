# Applied Crypto and Security

## Introduction
This repository contains custom implementations of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in C and the ElGamal encryption algorithm, demonstrating core cryptographic principles without the use of external libraries.


## Context
The focus of this coursework is to understand symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques, analyzing their mechanisms and security implications. DES is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data, while ElGamal provides a method for public-key encryption.

## Key Features
- **DES Implementation**: A complete implementation of the DES algorithm, showcasing key generation, encryption, and decryption processes in C.
- **ElGamal Implementation**: A comprehensive Python implementation of the ElGamal encryption algorithm, including key generation, encryption, and decryption functions.
